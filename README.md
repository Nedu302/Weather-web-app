# Weather-web-app
This weather web app uses Node.js for the backend and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to users. The project demonstrates full-stack development skills, including REST API setup, environment variable management, and responsive UI design.
